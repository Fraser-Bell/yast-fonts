yast-fonts
==========

This YaST module brings a layer over fontconfig settings to control
font appearance on the system in two aspects: 
* font rendering algorithm type,
* font family preference.

The main mission is to bring font rendering options closer 
to user. It is intended to weaken term 'default font setting'.
